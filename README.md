Global is a modern and sleek website template crafted for professionals in the creative industry. Global can serve as a single page portfolio or be easily modified to serve as the perfect beginning for a hip creative agency.

The original PSD is included and was provided by [Sergey Melnik](https://www.behance.net/SergeyMelnik).

This project was developed with HTML5, Sass, jQuery, and Hammer.js.

Performance basics are covered: assets are minified into single CSS and JS files, and the images are optimized.
